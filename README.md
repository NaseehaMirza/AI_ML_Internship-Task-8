# Decision Tree: Bank Marketing Subscription Prediction

## Objective
Build a Decision Tree model to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit.

## Dataset
Kaggle Bank Marketing Dataset.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Steps Performed
1. Loaded and explored dataset
2. Handled missing and unknown values
3. Encoded categorical features
4. Split data into training and testing sets
5. Trained Decision Tree with limited depth
6. Evaluated train vs test accuracy
7. Visualized decision tree
8. Interpreted decision rules

## Evaluation
The model achieved good accuracy while avoiding overfitting due to controlled tree depth.

## Outcome
This task demonstrates interpretable machine learning using decision trees and rule-based predictions.
